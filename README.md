A free utility for updating openFPGA cores, firmware, and related assets on your Analogue Pocket. It can run as an **interactive console menu** or from the **command line**.

A browsable list of available cores is here: [openFPGA cores inventory](https://openfpga-cores-inventory.github.io/analogue-pocket/).

Please use the [latest release](https://github.com/mattpannella/pupdate/releases/latest/) before reporting issues; older builds are not supported.

---

## Easy mode

Do **not** clone the repo if you only want to run the tool. Download the latest release, unzip it, place the executable for your OS on the **root of your SD card** (or another folder you use as the install path), and run it.

Use **Settings** from the main menu to walk through toggles, or edit `pupdate_settings.json` for advanced options.

---

## Interactive menu

The full menu tree is documented in **[MENU.md](MENU.md)**.

### Update All

The “do everything” option. Steps marked with * follow your **Settings** toggles.

1. Check for firmware updates *
2. Compress and backup Saves and Memories *
3. Install/update every **selected** core
4. Download missing required assets for selected cores *
5. Remove cores you have not selected (when that option is enabled) *
6. Run the instance JSON builder for supported cores (e.g. PC Engine CD) when enabled *
7. Rename Jotego cores to friendly titles when enabled *

**Pinned versions:** If a core has `pinned_version` set in settings, the updater resolves that version from the **inventory release list** only. If the pin does not match any listed release, that core is skipped with a message and the run continues.

### Update Selected

*(Pocket Maintenance)* — Pick installed cores to update.

### Install Selected

*(Pocket Maintenance)* — Pick cores you do not have installed yet; installs them without running a full Update All.

### Update Firmware

Checks for Pocket firmware updates only, then exits.

### Select Cores

Asks how **new** cores should be handled:

- **Yes** — All current cores selected; new cores auto-install as they appear.
- **No** — New cores are not installed automatically; you are not prompted. You then choose from the full list which cores to manage.
- **Ask** — Each run can prompt for new cores; you still choose from the full list for your baseline.

### Download Assets

Fetches missing assets (ROMs, BIOS, etc.) for **selected** cores from your configured archives.

*You supply your own ROMs for non-arcade cores where the archive does not provide them.*

### Backup Saves & Memories

Zips the Pocket **Saves** and **Memories** folders to the path in settings (default: `Backups` next to the executable unless overridden).

---

## Pocket Setup

### Display modes

- **Enable Recommended Display Modes** — Applies the curated list from [`display_modes.json`](display_modes.json) to the cores that reference those modes.
- **Enable Selected Display Modes** — You pick modes from the full list; they are applied to **all** installed cores that support them.
- **Enable Selected Display Modes for Selected Cores** — Same picker, then you choose which installed cores receive them.
- **Reset All / Selected Customized Display Modes** — Restore core defaults.
- **Change Display Modes Option Setting** — **Merge** (combine with core defaults), **Overwrite** (replace), or **Ask** each time.

To override the hosted `display_modes.json`, place a copy next to the executable and set `use_local_display_modes` to `true`.

### Download Platform Image Packs

Lists image packs (from [`image_packs.json`](image_packs.json)), downloads and extracts to `Platforms/_images`.

### Download Pocket Library Images

- **Spiritualized1997 (GB, GBC, GBA, GG)** — hardcoded in the app: `Library_Image_Set_v1.0.zip` from your configured archive.
- **All other submenu titles and items** come from [`pocket_library_images.json`](pocket_library_images.json) (bundled next to the executable), same idea as Pocket Extras. Each group has a **`menu_title`** (submenu label) and **`entries`** with **`menu_label`**, **`id`**, **`github_user`**, **`github_repository`**, and **`sources`**: an array of **`release_asset`** (zip on the release), **`path_under_extract`** (folder path inside that zip to `.bin` files, `/`-separated), and **`dest_images_subfolder`** (under `System/Library/Images/` on the device). Optional **`post_install_note`** is printed after a successful install (when any files were copied). Enable **Use a local pocket_library_images.json file** in Settings to read only the local copy instead of fetching the catalog from GitHub (see `use_local_pocket_library_images` in `pupdate_settings.json`).

CLI (like `pocket-extras`): `pocket-library-images` alone installs Spiritualized. **`pocket-library-images -l`** lists catalog entry **`id`** values; **`-n <id>`** installs that entry; **`-n <id> -i`** prints details. Example: `pocket-library-images -n codewario_boxarts`.

### Download GameBoy Palettes

Downloads palette packs maintained by [davewongillies](https://github.com/davewongillies/openfpga-palettes) and others (see original palette credits in prior releases); large collection of official and community palettes.

### Generating instance JSON files (PC Engine CD)

- Supported workflow is centered on **PC Engine CD**; put games under `/Assets/{platform}/common`, one game per folder (full game title as folder name).
- Games should be **cue/bin**. The generated JSON uses the **cue file name** as the base name—name the cue with the full title too.
- **Update All** or **Generate Instance JSON Files** walks `common` and builds launch JSONs.
- Disable in Update All with `build_instance_jsons`: `false` in settings.
- Optional: local [`ignore_instance.json`](ignore_instance.json) with `use_local_ignore_instance_json` if you maintain exclusions.

### Generate Game & Watch ROMs

Create:

- `/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/artwork`
- `/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/roms`

Put `[game].zip` in each; run the menu item to build. Game & Watch **asset downloads** are configured under `archives` (core-specific archive for `agg23.GameAndWatch`)—enable/configure there rather than a separate global toggle.

### Super GameBoy aspect ratio

Apply **8:7** to chosen `Spiritualized.SuperGB*` cores, or restore **4:3**.

### Analogizer Config

**Jotego** vs **Standard** wizards for Analogizer JSON. See [Analogizer setup](#analogizer-setup).

### Patreon Config

Submenu under **Pocket Setup**.

- **Set Patreon Session Cookie (for JT Beta auto-fetch)** — Stores your browser `session_id` cookie for experimental Patreon-based `jtbeta.zip` auto-fetch. See [Jotego beta](#jotego-beta-cores) for full steps and caveats.
- **Test Patreon Session Cookie** — Verifies the cookie and whether the account is a Jotego patron (diagnostic only).

### Directory Locations

Submenu under **Pocket Setup**.

- **Set Backup Saves Location** — Folder where **Backup Saves & Memories** writes zip files. Default `Backups` is a relative path (resolved from the process **current directory** when the tool runs; use an absolute path if you need a fixed location). Clearing the value when prompted resets to `Backups`. Same as `config.backup_saves_location` in JSON.
- **Set Archive Cache Location** — When **Cache downloaded archive files locally** is enabled, this overrides the default cache folder under your user **LocalApplicationData** `pupdate\cache` (Windows) / equivalent. Leave empty (or save an empty line) to use that default. Same as `config.archive_cache_location`.
- **Set Temp Directory** — Where pupdate extracts downloads and temporary files. Empty means the OS temp folder (`Path.GetTempPath()`). Same as `config.temp_directory`.

### Set GitHub Token

Stores a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for GitHub API calls (higher rate limits than anonymous requests). The current value is shown when you open this item. You can also set `config.github_token` in `pupdate_settings.json`.

### Print openFPGA Category Structure

Prints a summary of platform categories and cores (debug / reference).

---

## Pocket Maintenance

- **Update Selected / Install Selected** — See above.
- **Reinstall All / Select Cores** — Clean reinstall of core files (ROMs and saves are not removed).
- **Uninstall Select Cores** — Optional removal of core-specific **Assets**; ROMs/saves untouched.
- **Manage ROM Set Archives** — Sync and manage ROM set definitions ([`romsets.json`](romsets.json)).
- **Prune Save States** — Trims old save states under Memories.
- **Clear Archive Cache** — Deletes cached archive downloads when **cache archive files** is enabled.
- **Pin/Unpin Core Version** — See [next section](#pin--unpin-core-version).

---

## Pin / unpin core version

For installed cores with a GitHub-backed inventory entry:

1. Choose **Unpin**, **Select from releases list**, **Enter version manually**, or **Go Back**.
2. **Select from releases list** opens a **paginated** list of versions from the inventory (newest-first by release date). Pick one to pin.
3. **Enter version manually** stores any string; it must match a **`metadata.version`** value in the inventory’s `releases` array for updates to succeed.

**Update behavior:** The pinned ZIP URL is taken **only** from the inventory release that matches the pin (with simple `v` prefix normalization). There is **no** GitHub API fallback for pins. If the pin is missing from `releases`, the core is **skipped** for that run with a clear message.

---

## Pocket Extras

Third-party bundles defined in [`pocket_extras.json`](pocket_extras.json). Each entry can show a description and links before install (`show_menu_descriptions` in settings).

- **Additional Assets** — Needs the base core; extends ROMs or multi-game support.
- **Combination Platforms** — Multiple cores under one platform entry.
- **Variant Cores** — Alternate core packages alongside the original.

Exact menu labels are built at runtime; see **[MENU.md](MENU.md)** for a current snapshot.

---

## Plugins

Pupdate can install and run plugins distributed as GitHub repos. Each plugin is a small program that can drive its own interactive flow inside pupdate. To install ROM packs, configure something on your Pocket, fetch external content, etc.

### Installing a plugin

**Pocket Extras → Plugins → Install from GitHub...** and paste either:

- a short slug like `owner/repo`, or
- a full URL like `https://github.com/owner/repo`

pupdate downloads the latest release of that repo. Example to try: `openfpga-library/pocket-plugin`.

### Running a plugin

After installing, the plugin appears in the same **Pocket Extras → Plugins** menu by its name. Select it and follow its prompts. Pick **Cancel** at any prompt to stop the plugin.

### Updating and uninstalling

- **Check for updates** - checks every installed plugin against its source repo and offers to update any that have a newer release.
- **Uninstall a plugin...** - pick one from the list and confirm.

### Creating a plugin

See [openfpga-library/pocket-plugin](https://github.com/openfpga-library/pocket-plugin) for the plugin contract, sample code, and release format. Distribute your plugin as a GitHub release that includes `plugin.wasm` and `plugin.json` as release assets. The release tag becomes the version pupdate uses for update checks.

## Settings

Toggles exposed in the **Settings** menu (stored in `pupdate_settings.json`):

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Download Firmware Updates | Firmware check during Update All |
| Download Missing Assets | Asset check during Update All |
| Only check assets for cores updated during 'Update All' | Skip the asset check for cores that are already up to date; only updated/installed cores get their assets checked |
| Build game JSON Files | Instance JSON builder during Update All |
| Delete cores, not managed by pupdate | Remove unmanaged cores from SD when enabled |
| Automatically rename Jotego cores | Friendly platform names after install |
| Use CRC check | Verify assets by CRC; re-download if mismatch |
| Preserve Platforms folder | Avoid overwriting `Platforms` on Update All |
| Skip alternative ROMs | Ignore `_alternatives` folders when fetching assets (default on) |
| Compress and backup Saves and Memories | Backup during Update All |
| Show Menu Descriptions | Prompts/descriptions for Pocket Extras and similar |
| Use custom archive | Use the preconfigured “custom” archive entry instead of default archive.org |
| Automatically install updates to Pupdate | Self-update without prompt on startup |
| Use Local Pocket Extras | Use local `pocket_extras.json` |
| Use Local Display Modes | Use local `display_modes.json` |
| Cache downloaded archive files locally | Keep a reusable cache; optional cache path in JSON |
| Adds a description element to the video.json display modes | Non-breaking extra field in generated video JSON |
| Hide and uninstall Analogizer core variants | Hides Analogizer-specific core variants |
| Download files in concurrent chunks | Splits downloads into parallel HTTP range requests for faster transfers on bandwidth-limited servers like archive.org; falls back to a single connection when the server doesn't support ranges (default on). Tune the parallelism with `config.download_chunk_count` |

Game & Watch (and other **core-specific** archives) are enabled in the `archives` array in JSON, not via a separate Settings row.

---

## Additional settings

Edit `pupdate_settings.json` for keys that are not bool menu toggles:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `config.github_token` | Used for GitHub API calls (rate limits); also settable under **Pocket Setup → Set GitHub Token** |
| `config.download_new_cores` | `yes` / `no` / `ask` — set by Select Cores |
| `config.display_modes_option` | `merge` / `overwrite` / `ask` |
| `config.backup_saves_location` | Backup output directory; **Pocket Setup → Directory Locations → Set Backup Saves Location** |
| `config.temp_directory` | Override temp extract path (default: OS temp); **Pocket Setup → Directory Locations → Set Temp Directory** |
| `config.archive_cache_location` | Override archive cache directory when caching is on; **Pocket Setup → Directory Locations → Set Archive Cache Location** |
| `config.download_chunk_count` | Number of parallel HTTP range chunks when **Download files in concurrent chunks** is on (default `4`); ignored for files under 1 MB or servers without range support |
| `config.suppress_already_installed` | Reduce “already installed” console noise |
| `config.use_local_cores_inventory` | Use local **`cores.json`** and **`platforms.json`** (openFPGA Library **v3** format) next to the executable |
| `config.use_local_blacklist` | Use local `blacklist.json` instead of downloading |
| `config.use_local_image_packs` | Use local `image_packs.json` |
| `config.use_local_ignore_instance_json` | Use local `ignore_instance.json` |
| `archives` | Archive definitions: `internet_archive`, `custom_archive`, `core_specific_archive`, `core_specific_custom_archive` (see below) |
| `credentials.internet_archive` | Optional archive.org username/password |
| `core_settings.<core_id>.*` | Per core: `skip`, `download_assets`, `platform_rename`, `pocket_extras`, `pocket_extras_version`, `display_modes`, `original_display_modes`, `selected_display_modes`, `requires_license`, **`pinned_version`** |

### Asset blacklist

[`blacklist.json`](blacklist.json) lists filenames **not** downloaded as assets. Entries support `*` and `?` wildcards; matching applies to the full slot path and to the file name alone (useful for paths like `subfolder/game.bin`).

---

## Asset source archives

The `archives` array in `pupdate_settings.json` defines where assets come from. Stock config includes a default **archive.org** archive and a **Retrodriven** custom archive; you can switch via **Use custom archive** or edit JSON.

**Types**

- **`internet_archive`** — `name`, `archive_name` (archive.org identifier).
- **`custom_archive`** — `name`, `url`, `index` (index format per [archive.org JSON API](https://archive.org/developers/md-read.html)).
- **`core_specific_archive`** — Same as internet_archive but scoped to one core `name`; optional `file_extensions` **or** `files` (not both); optional `one_time`.
- **`core_specific_custom_archive`** — Like core-specific but with `url` + `index`.

Example `core_specific_archive`:

```json
{
    "name": "Spiritualized.2600",
    "type": "core_specific_archive",
    "archive_name": "htgdb-gamepacks",
    "files": [
      "@Atari 2600 2021-04-06.zip"
    ],
    "enabled": true,
    "one_time": true
}
```

---

## Internet Archive credentials

Some items need login. Add to `pupdate_settings.json`:

```json
"credentials": {
  "internet_archive": {
    "username": "me@something.com",
    "password": "12345"
  }
}
```

---

```

**Non-interactive use (`-y` / `--yes`):** a global flag. With it, pupdate assumes the default/affirmative answer to every prompt (install new cores, display modes, etc.) and skips the self-update prompt, so it can run unattended (CI, cron, containers). pupdate also returns a **non-zero exit code** when an update fails or an unhandled error occurs, so scripts can detect failures.

**Examples**

```text
pupdate -p /path/to/sdcard/
pupdate update -c boogermann.bankpanic
pupdate update -p /path/to/sdcard/ --yes      # unattended; non-zero exit on failure
pupdate assets -c jotego.jtcontra
pupdate images -i pocket-platform-images -o dyreschlock -v home
pupdate validate-cores
pupdate validate-cores --fix
```

## Jotego beta cores

Place **`jtbeta.zip`** from Patreon on the **root of the SD card** (exact name). **Update All** copies the beta key into the folders that need it. Do not rename the file.

### Auto-fetching `jtbeta.zip` (optional)

Pupdate can download the latest `jtbeta.zip` for you. **Manual placement (putting `jtbeta.zip` on the SD root yourself) always wins** — auto-fetch only runs when no manual key is present. Two optional sources are supported; if both are enabled, GitHub is tried first and Patreon is the fallback.

**Option A — GitHub (recommended):**

Jotego distributes `jtbeta.zip` via a private GitHub repo (`jotego/jtbeta`). Per Jotego's own [Beta Files FAQ](https://github.com/jotego/jtbin/wiki/Beta-Files-FAQ), access is granted to **GitHub Sponsors of Jotego** — and since Jotego's [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/jotego) accepts Patreon as a payment route, existing Patreon patrons can get the same sponsor status (and therefore the repo invite) by linking their Patreon to their GitHub account.

1. Make sure you have an active paid Jotego subscription. Either:
   - Subscribe directly on [Jotego's GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/jotego), or
   - If you're already a Patreon patron, [link your Patreon account to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/sponsoring-an-open-source-contributor-through-patreon) so GitHub recognizes your Patreon subscription as a sponsorship.
2. Accept the invite to `jotego/jtbeta` once it arrives.
3. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with read access to private repos (classic PAT with `repo` scope, or a fine-grained PAT with `Contents: Read` on `jotego/jtbeta`).
4. Set `github_token` in `pupdate_settings.json` to that PAT.
5. Enable **Auto-fetch Jotego jtbeta.zip from GitHub** in the Settings menu.

**Option B — Patreon session cookie (experimental, fallback):**

> **Experimental and flaky.** This uses Patreon's undocumented frontend API with your browser session cookie, not a supported public API. Cookies expire (usually in weeks, sooner if you log out or clear cookies), and Patreon can change response field names without notice. Prefer Option A if you have any way to. Treat this as a best-effort fallback, not a stable integration.

>  pupdate will **never** use your Patreon session cookie for anything other than making HTTP requests to `patreon.com` to locate and download `jtbeta.zip` (and, if you run the diagnostic, to verify your login and Jotego membership). It's stored locally in `pupdate_settings.json` and is never sent to any third party, telemetry endpoint, or server that isn't `patreon.com`.

1. Open <https://www.patreon.com> in your browser and log in.
2. Open DevTools (F12 or ⌘⌥I) → **Application** (Chrome/Edge/Brave) or **Storage** (Firefox) → **Cookies** → `https://www.patreon.com`.
3. Copy the **value** of the `session_id` cookie.
4. In pupdate: **Pocket Setup → Patreon Config → Set Patreon Session Cookie**, paste the value.
5. Enable **Auto-fetch Jotego jtbeta.zip from Patreon** in the Settings menu.

Use **Pocket Setup → Patreon Config → Test Patreon Session Cookie** to verify the cookie works and whether your account is currently a Jotego patron.

**Notes:**

- Your subscription/access must actually grant beta privileges — pupdate will tell you if it doesn't.
- Auto-fetch failures never break an update run; you can always fall back to placing `jtbeta.zip` on the SD root manually.

## Analogizer setup

**Pocket Setup → Analogizer Config** — choose **Standard** ([RndMnkIII](https://github.com/RndMnkIII)) or **Jotego** flow. For problems with generated files, ask the core author. [Supported cores](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer/wiki/Supported-Cores-and-How-to-Configure-Them).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Slow assets** — Try **Use custom archive** or another archive entry in `archives`.
- **`Error in framework RS: bridge not responding`** — Run pupdate on a local disk, then copy results to the SD card.
- **`Missing ROM ID [1]` in `_alternatives`** — Turn **off** “Skip alternative ROMs” if you need those files installed.
- **Pinned core skipped** — Pin must match a version string present in the core’s inventory `releases` list.
- **GitHub API rate limit** — Add a token via **Pocket Setup → Set GitHub Token** or `config.github_token` in `pupdate_settings.json`.
- **`Failure processing application bundle` / `Default extraction directory ... is not accessible`** — Happens when running in a container (or any environment) where `$HOME` points to a directory that does not exist or is not writable. Either set `DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR` (or `HOME`) to a writable path, or download `pupdate_linux_container*.zip` from the release instead of `pupdate_linux*.zip`. The container variant places the native libs next to the binary so no runtime extraction is needed. Extract the whole archive and run `pupdate` from there.

---

## Developers

- **.NET** — `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet run --project pupdate.csproj -- [verb] [options]`.
- **Layout** — `src/Program.cs`, `src/partials/`, `src/services/`, `src/models/`, `src/options/`, `src/tui/` (the `--tui` interface).
